It was collected in 2011. Echo Nest worked in collaboration with LabROSA, which uses intelligent machine listening, enabling the collection of certian data points\n\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\n\nIn addition to “strings” referencing the names of artists and the style of music with which they are associated, there are many “float” variables to measure things such as how often an artist’s songs conform with the style with which they are associated, the average start times of bars and beats in their songs, the loudness of the track, and other variables associated with details of each song."

The goal is to establish what aspect of each genre of music makes it most appealing to listeners of that music, and whether those tastes change. Our hypothesis is that the best explanatory variable changes by year for rock, but not for country and jazz.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nBesides the categorical variables used to identify the song id and genre, the rest of the variables should be quantitative—notably year, level of popularity (which is given on a scale of 0 to 1), tempo, beat interval, etc."

It was originally collected by collecting information from Forbes along with other sources for some variables. For others, the author derived values by doing calculations on information from existed variables.\n\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\n\nFrom Source: The data shows that the median age of a company of a European billionaire is nearly 20 years older than that of an American billionaire. Traditional sectors explain more than half of the rise in wealth in Europe; the financial sector and technology-related sectors together are largely responsible for the rise in US wealth."

However, one per data set is required.)\n\nAre more billionaires in richer countries self made compared to billionaires in poorer countries?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nThe research topic is global billionaire wealth. We want to focus on how inheritance affects wealth, and how different countries have different proportions of self-made billionaires. This can help aid understanding economic inequality within countries and how the wealth of a country can aid or hurt one's ability to become a self-made billionaire. We hypothesize that there will be a higher proportion of self-made billionaires in richer countries compared to billionaires in poorer countries because richer countries may have higher mobility and better education.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThe variables that we would measure to help explain the research question are quantatative and categorical. To measure inheritance, the data set has a categorical variable that measures if the wealth is inherited and how it is inherited if it is. To measure wealth of a country where the billionaire lives, we can measure the GDP of the country, a quantatative variable. To measure wealth, we can measure billionare rank compared to the rest of the billionaires and their worth in billions which are both quantative."
