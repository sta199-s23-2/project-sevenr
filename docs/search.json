It was collected in 2011. Echo Nest worked in collaboration with LabROSA, which uses intelligent machine listening, enabling the collection of certian data points\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nIn addition to “strings” referencing the names of artists and the style of music with which they are associated, there are many “float” variables to measure things such as how often an artist’s songs conform with the style with which they are associated, the average start times of bars and beats in their songs, the loudness of the track, and other variables associated with details of each song."

The goal is to establish what aspect of each genre of music makes it most appealing to listeners of that music, and whether those tastes change. Our hypothesis is that the best explanatory variable changes by year for rock, but not for country and jazz.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nBesides the categorical variables used to identify the song id and genre, the rest of the variables should be quantitative—notably year, level of popularity (which is given on a scale of 0 to 1), tempo, beat interval, etc."

What makes for a pop song?\nNicholas Borg and George Hokkanen\nhttp://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2011/BorgHokkanen-WhatMakesForAHitPopSong.pdf \n\nThis research article is about the possibility of predicting a hit song based on song features and genre detection. In terms of the data, they took a dataset of 10,000 songs that contained information such as loudness, tempo, key, and other musical features for each song, and they measured the popularity of each song based on the view counts for the song on YouTube. On initial preliminary analysis using basic correlation coefficients, they found that factors like tempo, loudness, and danceability had very weak correlations to song popularity. They faced difficulties because a lot of the variables they measured are largely based on song length, so they had to manipulate the data to normalize this so that the numbers were consistent. They found that there was very little from the audio features of the song that could accurately predict its popularity, and they reasoned that social factors such as the artist’s popularity were better predictors. They did have some success at using these factors to predict the song’s genre, though, which could be an interesting angle.\nOur research question builds on this because we also are looking at various musical features such as pitch, tempo, and loudness and seeing how well they predict a song’s popularity based on certain genres. We also are going to see if any of the relationships change based on year too. Hopefully we can reach a better conclusion than the articles and find some interesting connections."

We want to focus on how inheritance affects wealth, and how different countries have different proportions of self-made billionaires. This can help aid understanding economic inequality within countries and how the wealth of a country can aid or hurt one’s ability to become a self-made billionaire. We hypothesize that there will be a higher proportion of self-made billionaires in richer countries compared to billionaires in poorer countries because richer countries may have higher mobility and better education.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nThe variables that we would measure to help explain the research question are quantitative and categorical. To measure inheritance, the data set has a categorical variable that measures if the wealth is inherited and how it is inherited if it is. To measure wealth of a country where the billionaire lives, we can measure the GDP of the country, a quantitative variable. To measure wealth, we can measure billionaire rank compared to the rest of the billionaires and their worth in billions which are both quantitative."

For example, India is undergoing extreme class polarization; while the billionaires are used as evidence of India’s growing wealth, in reality people are growing poorer and poorer.

We found that the best predictors were the billionaire’s age and the industry of the billionaire’s company. With that being said, even though these were the best predictors, they only yielded an \\(R^2\\) of 0.19 and an adjusted \\(R^2\\) of 0.12 for inherited billionaires and an \\(R^2\\) of 0.05 and an adjusted \\(R^2\\) of -0.02 for non-inherited billionaires. They are clearly better predictors for inherited billionaires than non-inherited billionaires, but are poor predictors in general. This suggests that a billionaire’s worth cannot be strongly predicted by factors such as these, and that there are other attributes outside of this dataset that are contributing to their wealth.\nBased on our histogram and analysis focusing on company industry, we can see that for both types of billionaires the most frequent industry is Consumer goods, retail, and restaurants, and the next highest is Money management. A notable difference though, is that there are 46 non-inherited billionaires compared to only 10 inherited billionaires from the technology industry (That’s about 6% of billionaires from the inherited group compared to about 19% of the not inherited group). This occurrence stands to reason considering the tech industry is relatively new and filled with booming startups."

    "text": "Research question and hypothesis\nThus, our research question is: what is the best indicator(s) for predicting a billionaire’s wealth? That is, what factors regarding a billionaire contribute the most to his/her wealth?\nOur hypothesis is that the industry of the billionaire’s field of work, the gdp of the billionaire’s country, and billionaire’s age will be included, as those seem to be pertinent to wealth accumulation. Since some industries are booming more than others and have higher wealth “ceilings” (ex. technology industry vs. media industry), we believe knowing the industry has a sizable impact on the billionaire’s wealth. We also hypothesize a positive linear relationship between a billionaire’s wealth and the gdp of their country due to the benefits of a strong economy, making the country gdp a good indicator. Lastly, we think there is another positive linear relationship between wealth and the billionaire’s age, as company founders that make up a large proportion of billionaires tend to accumulate more wealth over time, thus making age a good indicating variable as well.\nhttps://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/origins-superrich-billionaire-characteristics-database?ResearchID=2917"

    "text": "Literature Review\nJames Petras (2008) Global ruling class: Billionaires and how they “make it”, Journal of Contemporary Asia, 38:2,319-329, DOI: 10.1080/00472330701822355\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/00472330701822355?needAccess=true&role=button\nThe article discusses the rise of billionaires in several major countries and regions in the world, providing historical, social, and political context to explain how they acquired their wealth. The countries/regions mentioned are Russia, Latin America, China, and India. The major projected relevant details are the histories of each region, and if the billionaires inherited their wealth. For example, India is undergoing extreme class polarization; while the billionaires are used as evidence of India’s growing wealth, in reality people are growing poorer and poorer as the billionaires continue to exploit the system to gain more wealth. The article also lists the 3 general stages of becoming a billionaire in reference to these regions. What ties the regions together is that they are developing areas; although billionaires are emerging, one cannot conclude that the people themselves are growing wealthier.\nThe article only focuses on four regions in the world in relation to wealth of a country and number of billionaires. Our research question aims to expand the scope to the entire world, and rather than focus on the political/social backgrounds of the regions to explain billionaire wealth, we are focusing on the billionaires and their companies themselves, in addition to their country of residence. This article does make us reconsider our original hypothesis of there being a positive linear relationship between wealth and country gdp. We at first thought a lower country gdp would result in a lower billionaire wealth, but this article suggests that in many developing countries with lower gdps, the billionaires’ success is indifferent to that of the country’s success due to class polarization and unfair governments, so billionaires continue to acquire wealth despite the general population struggling. Country gdp might not be such a good indicating variable, but we will see if anything changes when we look at a new dataset."

There are 2614 observations and 22 variables. Not every observation is a unique billionaire; many are repeated up to three times (one at each time point). In addition, not every variable is statistically interesting; many, such as name, rank, and company.name are identifying variables. However, the other variables are statistically useful and interesting, and our goal is to investigate them.\nThe dataset was created in 2016 by Caroline Freund and Sarah Oliver, who are (or were) researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. They compiled the list of individuals from Forbes billionaire lists dating from 1996 to 2015. A large percentage of the additional information collected was publicly available, coming from sources such as Forbes, news articles, and company websites.\nOne caveat about this dataset, and any data categorizing wealth, is that defining wealth is a subjective matter. For example, Forbes had to make many choices in determining who to include in the lists used as sources for this dataset. One such choice was to exclude billionaires that obtained wealth from official positions (e.g. high government roles, state leader positions, etc.). Another choice was to exclude billionaires who obtained their wealth via illegal methods. In addition, individuals and companies may fabricate what they publish about themselves, or simply characterize themselves subjectively. Thus, when drawing conclusions from analysis of this dataset, we must be careful not to generalize statements about legal nonpolitical billionaires to any person on the planet who accumulates wealth."

    "text": "Data cleaning\nBefore any analysis, the dataset was tidied up.\n\nYear\nAs mentioned in the dataset description, the data was collected at three different years, 1996, 2001, and 2014. We filtered for a single year instead of working with the data over time to allow us to control for year when building our linear regression. We chose the year 2001 because location.gdp was a variable of interest, and 2001 is the most recent year for which there is data on GDP across the world (there is no GDP data for 2014 in this dataset). The variable wealth.worth.in.billions was also renamed to just wealth.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry\nAnother variable that is of interest is wealth.how.industry, whose values are strings representing the industries that made the billionaires wealthy. After renaming the variable, we combined related industries together. For example, “Venture capital”, “Hedge funds”, “Diversified financial”, and “Private equity/leveraged buyout” all fit into the “Money management” industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\ndemographics.age is another interesting variable; however, several billionaires have an age of 0 listed, which meant some had died before 2001. Because researching dozens of individual death dates or ages demands excessive effort, we decided to filter out any age with 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Type\nWe tidied up company.type for use by merging misspelled or mistyped values. In the end, the three values are “new”, “acquired”, and “other”, with “new” taking precedent over “acquired”.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Relationship\nHow the individual is related to their company (e.g. CEO, investor, founder, etc.) is represented by company.relationship. We cleaned it up similarly to company.type. The unique relation types are founder, chairman, CEO, owner, investor, and relation, with founder taking precedent over CEO, CEO over the joint category of chairman/investor/owner, and chairman/investor/owner over relation. President was collapsed into CEO, and employee and lawyer were collapsed into relation. Two observations where company relation is unknown were filtered out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Age\nHow old the company is may also give some insight. We calculated the age of the company by subtracting its founding year (from company.founded) from 2001, saving the results to a column named company.age. A single observation with 0 as a founding year was dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited Wealth\nFinally, the variable inherited is changed to a binary categorical variable. The end result of the cleaning is a dataset with 413 observations, each of which is a billionaire with information on them from the year 2001.\n\n\nRows: 413\nColumns: 24\n$ name                     <chr> \"Bill Gates\", \"Warren Buffett\", \"Paul Allen\",…\n$ rank                     <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 1…\n$ year                     <int> 2001, 2001, 2001, 2001, 2001, 2001, 2001, 200…\n$ company.founded          <int> 1975, 1962, 1975, 1977, 1980, 1962, 1962, 196…\n$ company.name             <chr> \"Microsoft\", \"Berkshire Hathaway\", \"Microsoft…\n$ company.relation         <chr> \"founder\", \"founder\", \"founder\", \"founder\", \"…\n$ company.sector           <chr> \" Software\", \" Finance\", \"technology\", \" soft…\n$ company.type             <chr> \"new\", \"new\", \"new\", \"new\", \"new\", \"new\", \"ne…\n$ age                      <int> 45, 70, 48, 56, 44, 53, 55, 57, 52, 81, 73, 4…\n$ demographics.gender      <chr> \"male\", \"male\", \"male\", \"male\", \"male\", \"male…\n$ location.citizenship     <chr> \"United States\", \"United States\", \"United Sta…\n$ location.country.code    <chr> \"USA\", \"USA\", \"USA\", \"USA\", \"SAU\", \"USA\", \"US…\n$ location.gdp             <dbl> 1.06e+13, 1.06e+13, 1.06e+13, 1.06e+13, 1.83e…\n$ location.region          <chr> \"North America\", \"North America\", \"North Amer…\n$ wealth.type              <chr> \"founder non-finance\", \"founder non-finance\",…\n$ wealth                   <dbl> 58.7, 32.3, 30.4, 26.0, 20.0, 18.8, 18.7, 18.…\n$ wealth.how.category      <chr> \"New Sectors\", \"Traded Sectors\", \"New Sectors…\n$ wealth.how.from.emerging <chr> \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True…\n$ industry                 <chr> \"Technology\", \"Consumer goods, retail, restau…\n$ wealth.how.inherited     <chr> \"not inherited\", \"not inherited\", \"not inheri…\n$ wealth.how.was.founder   <chr> \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True…\n$ wealth.how.was.political <chr> \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True…\n$ company.age              <dbl> 26, 39, 26, 24, 21, 39, 39, 39, 39, 39, 85, 2…\n$ inherited                <fct> Not inherited, Not inherited, Not inherited, …"

Below, company age is plotted in similar fashion as billionaire age. Most companies are younger than 100 years. We can see that the billionaires with wealth amounts above the majority (greater than $10 billion) are involved with companies that are 100 years old or younger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited Wealth\nJust how many billionaires inherit their wealth? The bar plot below shows that while most of the billionaires do not inherit their wealth, the difference in number between the two groups does not seem too significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a histogram displaying the distribution of total wealth when faceted by inheritance status. The data skews right for both distributions, suggesting that the majority of both types of billionaires have less than 10 billion USD. There appears to be more inherited billionaires in the 10-20 billion USD range, but more non-inherited billionaires in the 20+ billion USD range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  inherited     mean_wealth\n  <fct>               <dbl>\n1 Inherited            3.65\n2 Not inherited        3.29\n\n\nThe mean wealth of those who inherit their wealth seems to be higher than those who didn’t.\n\n\nIndustry\nNext, we visualize the proportion of various company industries, as well as wealth distributions by industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportions and numbers are summarized below. The consumer goods, retail, and restaurants industry seems to dominant the billionaire population in terms of number of billionaires, but billionaire wealth is highest on average in the technology industry, understandably. In terms of average billionaire wealth, the top four industries are “Technology” “Media”, “Consumer goods, retail, and restaurants”, and “Money Management”.\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  industry                            mean_wealth count percent_industry\n  <chr>                                     <dbl> <int>            <dbl>\n1 Consumer goods, retail, restaurants        3.97   119           28.8  \n2 Energy, mining, and metals                 2.08    33            7.99 \n3 Media                                      4.11    52           12.6  \n4 Money management                           2.76    81           19.6  \n5 Non-consumer industrial                    2.35     4            0.969\n6 Other                                      1.86    14            3.39 \n7 Real estate & construction                 2.59    54           13.1  \n8 Technology                                 4.80    56           13.6  \n\n\n\n\nCountry GDP\n\n\n\nThe mean GDP of all the locations the billionaires are based is 6.2615877^{12}. Below is a scatterplot displaying the relationship between GDP and wealth. There is not a clear relationship the two. While we see the billionaires with the highest amounts of wealth come from the countries with the highest GDP, there is not an apparent linear trend. The average wealth for each level of country gdp appears roughly the same, with the highest country gdp likely having a slightly higher average wealth."

    "text": "Multivariate linear regression\nWe plan to use multivariate linear regression to construct a model because we want to consider the effects of several of the variables in the dataset simultaneously on the wealth variable. The main question when constructing a multivariate linear regression model is which variables should be included and which variables should be excluded. One strategy to answer this question is backwards elimination. During backwards elimination, one starts with all variables of interest in the model. Then, each variable is excluded one at a time and the model is assessed to see if exclusion of the variable has improved it. If the model is improved with the variable gone, then it is removed and the process repeats until the model cannot be improved by variable exclusion any further. The criterion we use for variable exclusion is the AIC value, which characterizes how well the model fits the data. A lower AIC value means a better-fitting model, so if removing a variable results in a model with a lower AIC, then that is motivation for removing that variable from the model. We start with 8 variables which we considered interesting: age, company age, company relation, company type, industry, inheritance status, GDP, and wealth type.\n\nBackwards Elimination\nTables showing the AIC values at each step of the process are shown.
