It was collected in 2011. Echo Nest worked in collaboration with LabROSA, which uses intelligent machine listening, enabling the collection of certian data points\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nIn addition to “strings” referencing the names of artists and the style of music with which they are associated, there are many “float” variables to measure things such as how often an artist’s songs conform with the style with which they are associated, the average start times of bars and beats in their songs, the loudness of the track, and other variables associated with details of each song."

The goal is to establish what aspect of each genre of music makes it most appealing to listeners of that music, and whether those tastes change. Our hypothesis is that the best explanatory variable changes by year for rock, but not for country and jazz.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nBesides the categorical variables used to identify the song id and genre, the rest of the variables should be quantitative—notably year, level of popularity (which is given on a scale of 0 to 1), tempo, beat interval, etc."

What makes for a pop song?\nNicholas Borg and George Hokkanen\nhttp://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2011/BorgHokkanen-WhatMakesForAHitPopSong.pdf \n\nThis research article is about the possibility of predicting a hit song based on song features and genre detection. In terms of the data, they took a dataset of 10,000 songs that contained information such as loudness, tempo, key, and other musical features for each song, and they measured the popularity of each song based on the view counts for the song on YouTube. On initial preliminary analysis using basic correlation coefficients, they found that factors like tempo, loudness, and danceability had very weak correlations to song popularity. They faced difficulties because a lot of the variables they measured are largely based on song length, so they had to manipulate the data to normalize this so that the numbers were consistent. They found that there was very little from the audio features of the song that could accurately predict its popularity, and they reasoned that social factors such as the artist’s popularity were better predictors. They did have some success at using these factors to predict the song’s genre, though, which could be an interesting angle.\nOur research question builds on this because we also are looking at various musical features such as pitch, tempo, and loudness and seeing how well they predict a song’s popularity based on certain genres. We also are going to see if any of the relationships change based on year too. Hopefully we can reach a better conclusion than the articles and find some interesting connections."

We want to focus on how inheritance affects wealth, and how different countries have different proportions of self-made billionaires. This can help aid understanding economic inequality within countries and how the wealth of a country can aid or hurt one’s ability to become a self-made billionaire. We hypothesize that there will be a higher proportion of self-made billionaires in richer countries compared to billionaires in poorer countries because richer countries may have higher mobility and better education.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nThe variables that we would measure to help explain the research question are quantitative and categorical. To measure inheritance, the data set has a categorical variable that measures if the wealth is inherited and how it is inherited if it is. To measure wealth of a country where the billionaire lives, we can measure the GDP of the country, a quantitative variable. To measure wealth, we can measure billionaire rank compared to the rest of the billionaires and their worth in billions which are both quantitative."

For example, India is undergoing extreme class polarization; while the billionaires are used as evidence of India’s growing wealth, in reality people are growing poorer and poorer. The article also lists the 3 general stages of becoming a billionaire in reference to these regions.
